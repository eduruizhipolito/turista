    A Deployed Smart Contract: Submissions require a deployed contract. Scaffold Stellar eliminates boilerplate by generating smart contract projects written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly.

    A Front End: A functional user interface is required. The framework generates a frontend built with modern TypeScript + React tooling using Vite.
    
    Stellar Wallet Kit Integration: The front end must integrate the Stellar Wallet Kit, a feature that is included in the Scaffold Stellar template.
